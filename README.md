# Advent of Code: Go library stuff
These are basic tools and functions for the actual Advent Of Code solutions.

## Disclaimer
These are my personal solutions of the Advent Of Code (AOC). The code is 
*not indented* to be perfect in any kind of area.

If you think, there is a piece of improvement: Go to the code, 
fill a PR and we are all happy. Share the knowledge.
